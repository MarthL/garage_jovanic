* Master: We just merge all our progress in master branch

### Part 1. Database Vizualisation

We designed a full database scheme with Loop in purpose of predicting all features of our web application. This database also need a lot of relations, that's why we used SQL for this project. We also need to understand all the features to predict the administrator access for the staff of the garage.

### Part 2. Prototype Design

In order to have the entire graphic charter validated by the client, we have issued a complete layout before development, developed through the AdobeXD software with a prototyping system allowing it to interact as if it were on the original site so that it fully validates all the work done to date.

### Part 3. Development 

We were 4 developers for this project. Each weeks, we organized a meeting where we discuss about all the progress we made. We also used Trello to memorize all ideas. We finished after 2 months this project entierly. We also secured this project with administration interface that allows super-admin to add new ads, sales with CRUD administration tool.
